# Some technical information about the app ⚙

⭐ This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

⭐ We used **Material UI, Bootstrap 5.0 and CSS** for styling it.

⭐ We also used **Google Fonts** for awesome fonts.

<br/>

# Getting Started 👩‍💻

⭐ **`fork`** the repository to your account

⭐ **`git clone`** to clone the repo into your local system.

⭐ **`npm install`** to add all dependencies.

⭐ Add **`.env`** file with your personal **`MONGO_URI`**

⭐ Make your own personal **`OAuth application`** and copy the **client ID** in **`.env`** file.

⭐ **`npm run dev`** to start the next app on **`http://localhost:3000`**

⭐ **That's it you have it ready.**

🍟 Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** with your browser to see the result.

🍟 You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

🍟 [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

🍟 The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
